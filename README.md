## üßê About Terraform Push <a name = "about"></a>
Terraform Push is an automated continuous integration repository template for deploying Terraform configuration files into a GCP-backed project (support for other cloud providers coming soon). The CI/CD paradigm establishes version control repositories as the source of truth for your deployments. In this case, we will use GitHub and its capabilities (Github Actions and Repository Templating) to automate Terraform operations in a remote environment.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Setting up your own Terraform CI is now easy as it can get. Simply create a new reposity using Terraform Push as a template, add the necessaty secrets for your Github Actions and enjoy Terraforming!

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite needed to set up your Terraform CI is a working Google Cloud Project with billing enabled. For more information on how to [create and manage Google Cloud Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
