## 🧐 About Terraform Push <a name = "about"></a>
Terraform Push is an automated continuous integration repository template for deploying Terraform configuration files into a GCP-backed project (support for other cloud providers coming soon). The CI/CD paradigm establishes version control repositories as the source of truth for your deployments. In this case, we will use GitHub and its capabilities (Github Actions and Repository Templating) to automate Terraform operations in a remote environment.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Setting up your own Terraform CI is now easy as it can get. Simply create a new reposity using Terraform Push as a template, add the necessaty secrets for your Github Actions and enjoy Terraforming!

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite needed to set up your Terraform CI is a working Google Cloud Project with billing enabled. For more information on how to [create and manage Google Cloud Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
