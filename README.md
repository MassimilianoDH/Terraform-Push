## üßê About Terraform Push <a name = "about"></a>
Terraform Push is an automated continuous integration repository template for deploying Terraform configuration files into a GCP-backed project (support for other cloud providers coming soon). The CI/CD paradigm establishes version control repositories as the source of truth for your deployments. In this case, we will use GitHub and its capabilities (Github Actions and Repository Templating) to automate Terraform operations in a remote environment.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Setting up your own Terraform CI is now easy as it can get. Simply create a new reposity using Terraform Push as a template, add the necessaty secrets for your Github Actions and enjoy Terraforming!

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite needed to set up your Terraform CI is a working Google Cloud Project with billing enabled. For more information on how to [Creating and Managing Google Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

### Installing
- [Repository](###repository)
- [Bootstrap](###bootstrap)
- [Secrets](###secrets)
- [Machine User (optional)](###machine_user)

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
### Repository <a name = "repository"></a>
The first step of our process is to create a Github Repository using Terraform Push as a template. On the top right corner of this repo (Terraform Push), you will find a green button to use this template. Press it and follow the repository creation form.

### Bootstrap <a name = "bootstrap"></a>
After our codebase is created, we will need to Bootstrap our remote backend using the Terraform configuration file found inside our repo. Replace ORGANIZATION with the name of your project and follow the standard Terraform Init/Plan/Apply workflow. Since this backend won't require any changes afterwards, I would suggest deleting the local state for safety reasons.

### Secrets <a name = "secrets"></a>
Add the Github Actions secrets required for authentication. On the newly created repo go to Settings, then Secrets and Actions. Press New repository secret and add the following secrets:

GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY: Service account key generated by Google Cloud. More information on how to [Create and Manage Service Account Keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: SSH key pair used to log into private Terraform Module repositories. More information on [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

PAT_TOKEN: Personal Access Token used to log into PRs and comment Terraform Plan output. More information on [Creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

### Machine User (optional) <a name = "machine_user"></a>
To get our Terraform Plan outputs in a easy to access manner, these need to be posted as a comment on Pull Requests.  This can be done using your personal Github Account (not recommended) or it can be done using a Github Machine User. A machine user is no more than a dummy GitHub account that is granted write access on a per-repository basis. Use this account when adding [PAT_TOKEN](###secrets).
